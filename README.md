The 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season opens with the Super Bowl of racing: the Daytona 500. Fans will have plenty of ways to catch all of the action, even if they don't have cable.

Affectionately called “the Great American Race,” the Daytona 500 is one of the biggest events on the sports calendar. The Daytona International Speedway event has kicked off the NASCAR season every February for well over 40 years.

Last year, William Byron held off Alex Bowman to win the 2024 Daytona 500 despite leading for only four laps. Chase Elliott won Stage 1, while Ryan Blaney earned the Stage 2 victory. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. beat Joey Logano in double overtime to win the 2023 Daytona 500.

Richard Petty has a series-best seven Daytona 500 wins, followed by Cale Yarborough with four. Denny Hamlin is the only active driver with multiple victories (3).

Actor Anthony Mackie will serve as the race's 2025 grand marshal. The 46-year-old who has appeared in films such as "8 Mile," "Captain America: Civil War" and "Avengers: Endgame" will deliver the most important line of the weekend: "gentlemen, start your engines."
